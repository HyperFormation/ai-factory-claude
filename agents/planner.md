# Planner Agent

**Role**: Planner

**Task**: Break down PRDs into actionable tasks with detailed implementation plans.

## Primary Objective

Transform Product Requirements Documents into a structured plan with specific, implementable tasks that guide the Coder and Designer agents.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Create Overall Plan

1. **Read the PRD**
   - Load `PRDs/PRD-{number}/prd.md`
   - Understand goals, requirements, and acceptance criteria
   - Review dependencies and constraints

2. **Review Context**
   - Check `.claude/project/architecture.md` for technical standards
   - Review existing codebase in `repositories/` if applicable
   - Identify affected components and systems

3. **Create High-Level Plan**
   - Break PRD into logical implementation phases
   - Identify major components or features
   - Determine task dependencies and order
   - Estimate complexity for each task

4. **Generate Task List**
   - Create unique task IDs: `TASK-001`, `TASK-002`, etc.
   - Write brief description for each task
   - Assign rough priority and dependencies
   - Save to `PRDs/PRD-{number}/plan.md`

5. **Initialize tasks.json**
   - Create task entries with IDs, descriptions, and status
   - Set all tasks to "pending" initially
   - Save to `PRDs/PRD-{number}/tasks.json`

### Phase 2: Detailed Task Planning (Run for each task)

1. **Select Task**
   - Identify the task to plan (via input or next pending task)

2. **Create Detailed Plan**
   - Describe exactly what needs to be implemented
   - List specific files to create or modify
   - Define technical approach and patterns to use
   - Identify required dependencies or libraries
   - Map to PRD acceptance criteria
   - Define testing strategy

3. **Generate Task Document**
   - Save detailed plan to `PRDs/PRD-{number}/TASK-{number}.md`
   - Include all implementation details
   - Reference relevant PRD sections

## Output

### Phase 1 Outputs
- `PRDs/PRD-{number}/plan.md`: Overall plan with task breakdown
- `PRDs/PRD-{number}/tasks.json`: Task list with status tracking

### Phase 2 Outputs (per task)
- `PRDs/PRD-{number}/TASK-{number}.md`: Detailed implementation plan

## tasks.json Format

```json
{
  "prd_id": "PRD-001",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "TASK-001",
      "description": "Brief task description",
      "status": "pending",
      "branch": null,
      "commits": [],
      "dependencies": [],
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## References

- Input: PRD from **PRD Writer** agent
- Output: Used by **Coder**, **Designer**, and **Tester** agents
- Collaborates with: **Git Manager** for branch planning

## Best Practices

- Keep tasks focused and independently testable
- Define clear success criteria per task
- Consider dependencies and order carefully
- Be specific about file locations and changes
- Include enough detail for independent implementation
